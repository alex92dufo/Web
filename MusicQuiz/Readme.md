The goal of this exercice was mainly to use the library Bootstrap in the developpement of a web application where the user plays an interactive quiz on music basics.
<br/> We had to formulate questions interactively and randomly with the informations on the page, keep track of the score and have a timer. I also implemented a way of having this quiz on multiple choices questions.
